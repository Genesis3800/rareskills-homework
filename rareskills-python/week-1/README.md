# Week 1 Recap

### Main Notes

- First 7 problems were solved using simple python scripts.
- I tried to document my thought process as it evolved.
- The last problem made sense to solve on paper. I have uploaded pictures, but of course I'll
implement it in both python & Rust soon.

### Some More Notes

- Is my approach to modulos correct? As in approach the number from the left to find the modulus.
- Is there a correct way to look at Lagrange Interpolation?
- I need to look into congurency a bit more.
